# Melanoma Detection Assignment
To build a CNN based model which can accurately detect 9 different types of skin cancers like melanoma. Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early. It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths. In the skin biopsy, the dermatologist takes some part of the skin lesion and examines it under the microscope. 
Current process for detecting these type of cancers with Doctor appointment would span around 1-2 weeks which is quite large. This CNN model is aimed at reducing this detection period to a couple of days. The approach uses Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify nine types of skin cancer from outlier lesions images.

## Dataset
-The dataset consists of 2357 images of malignant and benign oncological diseases, which were formed from the International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC). All images were sorted according to the classification taken with ISIC, and all subsets were divided into the same number of images.
Sample image per class from dataset:

The data set contains the following diseases:

To overcome the issue of class imbalance, used a python package Augmentor (https://augmentor.readthedocs.io/en/master/) to add more samples across all classes so that none of the classes have very few samples.
