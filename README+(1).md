# Melanoma Detection Assignment
To build a CNN based model which can accurately 9 different types of skin cancers pdetect melanoma. Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early. It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths. In the skin biopsy, the dermatologist takes some part of the skin lesion and examines it under the microscope. 
Current process for detecting these type of cancers with Doctor appointment would span around 1-2 weeks which is quite large. This CNN model is aimed at reducing this detection period to 2 days. The approach uses Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify nine types of skin cancer from outlier lesions images.
